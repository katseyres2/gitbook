# 7. Network-based attacks

### Part 1

Network services : `ARP` `DHCP` `SMB` `FTP` `Telnet` `SSH` Man in the Middle :

### Tshark

```bash
tshark -D # list interfaces
tshark -i eth0
tshark -r HTTP_traffic.pcap
tshark -r HTTP_traffic.pcap -z io,phs -q  # hierarchy statistics
```

### Filtering basics

```bash
# 1. Command to show only the IP packets sent from IP address 192.168.252.128 to IP address 52.32.74.91?
tshark -r HTTP_traffic.pcap 'ip.src==192.168.252.128 && ip.dst==52.32.74.91'

# 2. Command to print only packets containing GET requests?
tshark -r HTTP_traffic.pcap 'http.request.method==GET'

# 3. Command to print only packets only source IP and URL for all GET request packets?
tshark -r HTTP_traffic.pcap -T fields -e ip.src -e ip.dst 'http.request.method==GET'

# 4. What is the destination IP address for GET requests sent for New York Times (www.nytimes.com)?
tshark -r HTTP_traffic.pcap 'dns'|grep www.nytimes.com
tshark -r HTTP_traffic.pcap -Y 'http.request.method==GET && http.host==www.nytimes.com' -T fields -e ip.dst

# 5. What is the session ID being used by 192.168.252.128 for Amazon India store (amazon.in)?
tshark -r HTTP_traffic.pcap -Y 'ip.src==192.168.252.128 && ip contains amazon.in' -T fields -e ip.dst -e http.cookie

# 6. What type of OS the machine on IP address 192.168.252.128 is using (i.e. Windows/Linux/MacOS/Solaris/Unix/BSD)? Bonus: Can you also guess the distribution/flavor?
tshark -r HTTP_traffic.pcap -Y 'ip.src==192.168.252.128 && http' -T fields -e ip.dst -e http.user_agent

# 7. How many HTTP packets contain the "password" string?
tshark -r HTTP_traffic.pcap -Y 'http contains password'
```

### ARP poisoning

```
```

### WiFi traffic analysis

1. What is the name of the Open (No Security) SSID present in the packet dump?
2. The SSID 'Home\_Network' is operating on which channel?

### Filtering advanced

1.  Which command can be used to show only WiFi traffic?

    ```
    tshark -r WiFi_traffic.pcap 'wlan'
    ```
2.  Which command can be used only view the deauthentication packets?

    ```
    tshark -r WiFi_traffic.pcap 'wlan.fc.type_subtype eq 12'
    ```
3.  Which command can be used to only display WPA handshake packets?

    ```
    tshark -r WiFi_traffic.pcap 'wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x08 || wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x05 || eapol'
    ```
4.  Which command can be used to only print the SSID and BSSID values for all beacon frames?

    ```
    tshark -r WiFi_traffic.pcap -T fields -e wlan.ssid -e wlan.bssid 'wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x08'
    ```
5.  What is BSSID of SSID “LazyArtists”?

    ```
    tshark -r WiFi_traffic.pcap -T fields -e wlan.bssid 'wlan.ssid contains LazyArtists'
    ```
6.  SSID “Home\_Network” is operating on which channel?

    ```
    tashark -r Wifi_traffic.pcap -Y 'wlan.ssid=Home_Network' -T fields -e wlan_radio.channel
    ```
7.  Which two devices received the deauth messages? State the MAC addresses of both.

    ```
    tshark -r WiFi_traffic.pcap -T fields -e wlan.bssid 'wlan.fc.type_subtype eq 12'
    ```
8.  Which device does MAC 5c:51:88:31:a0:3b belongs to? Mention manufacturer and model number of the device.

    ```
    tshark -r 'WiFi_traffic.pcap' -Y 'wlan.bssid==5c:51:88:31:a0:3b' -T fields -e user_agent
    ```
