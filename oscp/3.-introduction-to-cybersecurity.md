# 3. Introduction to Cybersecurity

## Practice of Cybersecurity

### Definitions

**Risk** (probability and impact)

1. Low-probability, low-impact events
2. Low-probability, high-impact events
3. High-probability, low-impact events
4. High-probability, high-impact events

**Questions you must examine**

* "How likely is it that a particular attack might happen?"
* "What would be the worst possible outcome if the attack occurs?"

**Other definitions**

* A <mark style="color:yellow;">threat</mark> poses a risk to an asset we care about protecting.
* A <mark style="color:yellow;">threat actor</mark> is a person or group of people embodying a threat.
* A <mark style="color:yellow;">vulnerability</mark> is a flaw that allows a threat to cause harm.
* An <mark style="color:yellow;">exploit</mark> is a procedure for abusing a particular vulnerability.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">To exploit</mark> a vulnerability is to perform the procedure that reliably abuses it.
* An <mark style="color:yellow;">attack surface</mark> describes all the points of contact on our system or network that _could_ be vulnerable to exploitation.
* An <mark style="color:yellow;">attack vector</mark> is a specific vulnerability and exploitation combination that can further a threat actor's objectives.

### Threat Actor List

> _In the cybersecurity industry that the attacker only needs to succeed once, while the defender must succeed every time._

* The <mark style="color:yellow;">individual malicious actors</mark> are anyone attempting to do something that they are not supposed to do that fits into this category.
* A <mark style="color:yellow;">malicious group</mark> comes in when individuals band together to form groups, they often become stronger than their individual group members.
* An <mark style="color:yellow;">insider threat</mark> is anyone who already has privileged access to a system and can abuse their privileges to attack it.
* The <mark style="color:yellow;">nation states</mark> well-financed operators of cyber attacks exist at the nation-state level within many different countries across the globe.

### Recent Breaches

* <mark style="color:yellow;">Social engineering</mark> represents a broad class of attacks where an attacker persuades or manipulates human victims to provide them with information or access that they shouldn't have.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Spearphishing</mark> targets specific individuals.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Phishing</mark> is a more general class of attack relative to spearphishing. It is usually done in broad sweeps. It is usually to try to send a malicious communication to as many people as possible.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Business Email Compromise</mark> or BEC is a phishing scam.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Ransomware</mark> is a type of malware that infects computer systems and then locks a legitimate user from accessing it properly.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Credential abuse</mark> can occur when an attacker acquires legitimate credentials, allowing them to log into machines or services that they otherwise would not be able to.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Authentication bypass</mark> can allow attackers to ignore or step around intended authentication protocols.

Solutions to prevent BEC:

* Verify the legitimacy of any request for payment, purchase, or changes to account information or payment policies in person.
* If this is not possible, verify legitimacy over the phone.
* Be wary of requests that indicate urgency.
* Carefully inspect email addresses and URLs in email communications.
* Do not open email attachments from people that you do not know.
* Carefully inspect the email address of the sender before responding.

## CIA Triad

> _**Confidentiality**: can actors who should not have access to the system or information access the system or information?_
>
> **Integrity**: c_an the data or the system be modified in some way that is not intended?_
>
> _**Availability**: are the data or the system accessible when and how they are intended to be?_

* A system is <mark style="color:yellow;">Confidential</mark> if the only people who can access it are the people explicitly permitted to do so.
* A system has <mark style="color:yellow;">Integrity</mark> if the information and functionality it stores is only that which the owner intends to store. Integrity is concerned with maintaining the accuracy and reliability of data and services.
* A system is considered <mark style="color:yellow;">Available</mark> if the people who are supposed to access it can do so. Imagine an attacker has gained access to a social media account and also posted some content of their choosing.

## Security

**Principles**

* The <mark style="color:yellow;">Least Privilege</mark> principle expresses the idea that each part within a system should only be granted the lowest possible privileges needed to achieve its task.
* The model of <mark style="color:yellow;">Zero Trust</mark> advocates for removing all implicit trust in networks and has a goal of protecting access to resources, often with granular authorization processes for every resource request.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Open Security</mark> states that the security of a system should not depend on its secrecy.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Defense in Depth</mark> advocates for adding defenses to as many layers of a system as possible, so that if one is bypassed, another may still prevent full infiltration.

**Strategies**

* 24/7 vigilance
* Threat modelling
* Table top discussions
* Continuous training on tactics, processes, and procedures
* Continuous automated patching
* Continuous supply chain verification
* Secure coding and design
* Daily log reviews
* Multiple layers of well-implemented Security Controls

**Defensive techniques**

* The idea of <mark style="color:yellow;">Shift-Left</mark> security is to consider security engineering from the outset when designing a product or system, rather than attempt to bake it in after the product has been built.
* With <mark style="color:yellow;">Shamir's Secret Sharing</mark> or SSS, we might design a system so that three different administrator authorizations are required to authorize any one administrative root access. Shamir's secret sharing scheme enables a system to split access authorization requirements between multiple systems or persons.
* [Threat modeling](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/threat\_modeling) describes taking data from real-world adversaries and evaluating those attack patterns and techniques against our people, processes, systems, and software.
* [Threat Intelligence](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/threat\_intelligence) is data that has been refined in the _context_ of the organization: actionable information that an organization has gathered via threat modeling about a valid threat to that organization's success.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Continuous Automated Patching</mark> is accomplished by pulling the upstream source code and applying it to the lowest development environment. Next, the change is tested and only moved to production if it is successful.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Continuous Supply Chain Validation</mark> occurs when people and systems validate that the software and hardware received from vendors are the expected material and that it hasn't been tampered with, as well as ensuring output software and materials are verifiable by customers and business partners.
* [Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/tactics\_techniques\_and\_procedures), or TTPs handle various scenarios to decrease incident response time.
* [Business Continuity Planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business\_continuity\_planning) or BCP includes many other aspects such as live drill responses to situations like ransomware and supply-chain compromise. BCP extends outside of cybersecurity emergencies to include processes and procedures for natural disasters and gun violence.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Sleeper malware</mark> is software that is inactive while on a system for a period of time before it starts taking action.
* A [Software Bill of Materials](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom) or SBOM as a way to track dependencies automatically in the application build process greatly helps us evaluate supply chain tampering.
* One ephemeral encryption is [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport\_Layer\_Security)_,_ in which nobody but the server and the client of that specific interaction can decrypt the information (not even the administrators), and the decryption keys only exist in memory for a brief time before being discarded.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Personal Identifiable Information</mark> or PII can include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, SSNs, and other information that can be used to track down or spy on an individual person.
* [Chaos Testing](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/manage/practice\_chaotic\_testing/) is a type of BCP or DR (Disaster Recovery) practice that is often handled via automation. For example, we might leverage a virtual machine that has valid administrative credentials in the production network to cause intentional disasters from within.
